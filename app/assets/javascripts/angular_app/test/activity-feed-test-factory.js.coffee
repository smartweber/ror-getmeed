        'description': 'memcached has been widely used in social network applications and deployed at the large scale (Facebook, Wikipedia, Twitter, Box). One of the major challenges is how to maintain the consistency between cache layer and persistent-storage layer. We designed and developed a framework to support strong consistency in these Cache Augmented Database Management Systems. Our proposed framework uses I lease (extend of the Facebook lease) and Q lease to prevent undesirable race conditions that may cause the cache to store stale data. <br/><a href="http://2014.middleware-conference.org/program/accepted/">http://2014.middleware-conference.org/program/accepted/</a>'

        'description': '<span>A month ago, a mother asked Rich Barton, Co-founder of Zillow whether her son should join a startup. Despite an awesome response from Rich, we often find the choice subjective and opinions polarized. We at resu.me believe in empowering students with data in making career choices, so we bring the quantitative answers to some of the questions that need to be answered in making such choices in a series of blog posts.<br>We use information from profiles of 1000+ companies, 2000+ jobs and students data from 25+ universities to analyze and derive answers for you.<br><br><strong>Financial incentives:</strong><br>Agree or not, financial compensation is one of the important factors for students to make the choice. We don’t necessarily pick up highest paying job, so how do startups pay compared to big companies?<br><br>From the data, it appears that the average salary compensation for startups and big companies is comparable. But, startups seem to pay very high than big companies for exceptional people. <br>Also, Big companies tend to pay lot more in bonus (overall, cash and stock). However the intrinsic value of a startup stock increases in future and upon success of startups is usually not measured and hence the overall stock bonus compensation can be higher or lower than the quoted amounts here.</span>'

I think it's easy to get caught up in the excitement of college and the rigor of classes, but what the first years of college should really be about is exploring for the purpose of developing oneself. This could mean academic development, in the form of taking new classes and trying out new fields, or personal development, in the form of exposing oneself to new types of people and activities. My advice would be to never be afraid to try new things and have new experiences.</li></ul><strong>What I wished I knew when thinking about internships?<br></strong><ul><li>There are a few things here. (1) Start looking early: many companies start hiring as early as October or November, so the earlier you're getting your resumé out there, the better chance you have of getting an awesome internship. (2) Prior to searching for internships, figure out what area you might be interested in and do some cool projects in this area. Whether you're into iPhone app development or computer security or data analytics, there are a multitude of ways in which you can build out a side project; this gives you experience as well as shows companies that you can take initiative.</li></ul><strong>Why I decided to join Nutanix?<br></strong><ul><li>For me, the biggest factor in deciding which company to join this summer was the work that I would be doing. I determined that I would have the opportunity to do the most interesting work here at Nutanix, since I was hired into a very exciting team, working with some brilliant people. I saw Nutanix as the best opportunity for me to get exposure to some of the smartest people in the industry, which was a big reason for my decision. It's important to realize that internships are not the end-all, but rather just one step in your career growth process, so make sure to choose an internship which you think will help you grow the most, not necessarily the one which pays the best or has the best perks.</li></ul><strong>What projects have I worked on?<br></strong><ul><li>This summer, I was hired into the data analytics team, where I was given an opportunity to work on an upcoming product for Nutanix which helps collect and analyze a ton of data related to the product infrastructure.

During her college years, she completed two program management internships with Microsoft. Now, she is one of the early members of the 6sense engineering team.</p>\r<br/><p>When looking for a full-time engineering job, Rita was very focused on finding a work environment that encouraged learning and provided support for those looking to expand their knowledge and skill sets. She also saw something unique in companies run by successful, ambitious women, and felt that these places provide a unique aspect of work life that other companies lacked.</p>\r<br/><p>I recently sat down with Rita to learn a little more about this and how she ended up where she is today.</p>\r<br/> Hired on Hired \r<br/><p>Rita Kozlov: I was using Hired to find a job when I first moved to San Francisco. It's pretty cool - you post a profile on Hired and companies can reach out to you. I got an email from one of 6sense's cofounders, Viral Bajaria, decided to go in for an interview.</p>\r<br/> A life-changing interview \r<br/><p>RK: First of all, I thought it was great to be contacted by the CTO himself. It showed me that I would be working directly with the leadership of the company and that they were genuinely interested in what I was doing.</p>\r<br/><p>To be completely honest, I didn't know much about predictive intelligence at first, but since I had just moved to San Francisco to find a job presumably just like this, I went to the interview. It was during this process that I really started to get excited, because I had the chance to ask the engineering team a lot of questions. It sounded like they were working on solving a lot of fascinating problems, and it was then that I knew that I wanted to work on big data related problems.</p>\r<br/><p>To add to that, everyone seemed very pleasant and willing to help new engineers. In every interview I went to, I stressed my desire to learn and grow and asked if the team was willing to support that by providing leeway and guidance. Here, they responded in an overwhelmingly positive way, noting that this was not only acceptable, but an integral part of the 6sense culture.</p>\r<br/> Making a visible impact \r<br/><p>RK: Right now I build internal tools for 6sense. I'm working on tools that enable our data scientists to do their jobs more efficiently and focus on actually building models for our customers, rather than trying to get data cleaned and sorted out. Essentially, I'm making the tasks of the data science team members easier and laying the foundation for a more streamlined onboarding process. The greatest part about my job is that I can see, on a daily basis, the impact that my work is having on the rest of the team.</p>\r<br/> B2B: the place to be \r<br/><p>RK: First, I knew that working at a big company wasn't for me. When I was going through a bunch of interviews via Hired, I already began weeding out the bigger companies because I knew I wanted to work somewhere smaller. 6sense was one of the remaining teams that I was considering joining, and after visiting the office and going through the interview process, I knew I really wanted to work here. There was something about the positive vibes of the office and the passion of the team that made me realize this was the place I wanted to be.</p>\r<br/> \r<br/><p>The cool thing to me was that I would be reporting to the person directly under the CEO, so the growth opportunity was huge. Also, when I was interviewing, everyone seemed excited to be working on what they were working on.</p>\r<br/> \r<br/><p>Lastly, I really liked the B2B aspect of 6sense. Consumer products are cool, but at this point, chances of becoming the next Facebook are pretty slim. You hear these new ideas for consumer products every day, and it's almost always something you've heard before. The idea of having a concrete B2B mission of knowing there was a gap in the market and filling it by solving real problems is very enticing to me.</p>\r<br/> A day in the life \r<br/><p>RK: I get in pretty early; I'm a morning person. I like to come in and work on some code before the day really starts picking up. Then, on Tuesdays and Thursdays I'll do yoga with the instructor that comes to the office every week, and attend standup. Every day, the tech team gets together and everyone shares what they've been working on, what they're going to be working on, and what's blocking them.</p>\r<br/><p>We work in two-week sprints, so every two weeks I'll get a set of activities to complete. Sometimes activities can change based on abilities and bandwidth, and we're always encouraged to seek help when necessary.</p>\r<br/> Female leadership and new friends \r<br/><p>RK: Another one of my absolute favorite things about 6sense is that we have a female CEO. This was actually something that I was looking for during my job search; there are certain aspects of woman-led companies that other companies simply lack. These can include benefits like insurance or maternity leave policies, but it goes beyond that. For example, what other company has a full shower in the bathroom for those who exercise before work and a CEO who teaches yoga?</p>\r<br/><p>On a more personal note, I'm still pretty new to San Francisco and didn't have many friends before I started my job. Since I've been here, I've made a lot of new friends. At first, I thought I was joining the 6sense team, but it didn't take long to realize that I was actually joining the 6sense family. You can really feel that everyone here is more than just coworkers.</p>\r<br/><p>6sense is hiring! If you're a data scientist or software engineer who wants to be a part of a smart, passionate team in a fast-paced, positive work environment,  apply today.</p>\r<br/> </div>","embed_code":null,"external_url":null,"feed_rank":1753,"internal_id":null,"is_anonymous":null,"is_user_following_company":true,"job_ids":["5553cd8a05af2ce6b2000018"],"jobs":[{"_id":"5553cd8a05af2ce6b2000018","company":"6sense","company_id":"6sense","company_logo":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/RhHYTdqhTyiJ7hbv9bye/convert?w=100","company_overview":"6sense is a B2B predictive intelligence engine for marketing and sales.

She impressed me with her passion for learning and desire to have her customers benefit from her knowledge. Her actions were linked always to her goal of making customers successful. She was vocal about customer issues, building better analysis, and new features on the platform. Her intellectual flexibility often led to novel approaches to display clever visualizations or expose gems in customer's data. The engine that drove her flexibility had been her ability to embrace mistakes by accepting, learning, and then building strength from them. Her drive, fueled by endless optimism, extended to her team, making her this unique individual I enjoyed collaborating with and respected. Amanda's infectious ingenuity captivated customers and colleagues alike.</p>\r<br/><p>We continued to keep in touch throughout the years, even as I've moved onto leading teams at Adobe, and Amanda to her own consulting firm. Two years ago, with a new focus on B2B predictive analytics, Amanda proposed we become colleagues once more. For over 20 years, I had worked many technologies from client/server applications, dotcom ecommerce platform, to web and customer analytics. I knew B2B predictive was uncharted territory and, at that time, did not have a dominant player. I could not think of a better person to partner with than Amanda. We embarked on this journey once again as colleagues with the personality and drive to win.</p>\r<br/><p>In our initial efforts to secure VC funding, Amanda impressed me once again, this time, with the strength in character she had built through her years as an entrepreneur. Over a grueling 11-month process of pitching our solution, being turned down, and re-tweaking and re-pitching our presentations, she never wavered and kept the same level of intensity with every VC meeting. Our effort was rewarded with the addition of Viral and the Hulu family into our team. We became 6sense and obtained our first round of VC funding! This first round propelled us to build the core 6sense platform, which fed the drive that led to the second round of funding from Bain. This new round from Bain validates 6sense's presence in the market, and prepares us for the next phase in our company's roadmap: to secure the talented people needed to scale, continue to innovate and build new, exciting features into our product to support the success of our customers!</p>\r<br/><p>The 6sense employees define our company culture. We are a mixed bag of eclectic individuals who collectively bring about something magical. Each of us offers a unique perspective to a problem, leading to well-formulated solutions in such discussions. We are respectful of everyone's contributions even when we are not in agreement, which at times brings out the best in our work. We understand the importance of our work. We are accountable for our work. We hold ourselves responsible for our commitments. We follow through on our agreements. We work hard and play even harder. We realize there is fun in work, especially work that helps our customers succeed. This caliber of people makes working at 6sense very rewarding.</p>\r<br/><p>6sense is uniquely positioned in the B2B predictive market. Our solution integrates thousands of B2B publishers, forums, and searches, and then ties these signals to each company's internal digital assets to show intent buying behavior and identify such companies in the various part of the purchase funnel. Our solution takes a set of complicated inputs, distills the data, and generates a set of simple results to the marketing/sales team. We are in the forefront of the B2B predictive intelligence, and we continue to evolve our platform to always meet the anticipated demands of our customers.</p>\r<br/><p>I'm privileged to be on our services team, where I witness first hand our customers' success thru the use of our solution. To witness the joy of our customers' initial reaction, when they realize the accuracy of 6sense results, is truly amazing. We take the guesswork out of their former process of identifying the right accounts/contacts to pass on to sales or to nurture. We are returning valuable time to the customer teams so that they can focus on marketing and sales.</p>\r<br/><p>The leadership in 6sense always welcomes new ideas and challenges each individual. By setting high standards, we expect that everyone deliver quality work. This drive is the makeup of the people we hire across engineering, data science, and services. Our customers demand excellence from 6sense, so we demand excellence from ourselves. Amada and I met ten years ago with our focus on helping customer succeed. As long as we stay on this course, 6sense will have longevity in the B2B predictive analytic space.</p>\r<br/></div>","embed_code":null,"external_url":null,"feed_rank":1753,"internal_id":null,"is_anonymous":null,"is_user_following_company":true,"job_ids":["5553cd8a05af2ce6b2000018"],"jobs":[{"_id":"5553cd8a05af2ce6b2000018","company":"6sense","company_id":"6sense","company_logo":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/RhHYTdqhTyiJ7hbv9bye/convert?w=100","company_overview":"6sense is a B2B predictive intelligence engine for marketing and sales.

It’s designed to streamline the process of onboarding new employees and getting them set up with payroll and benefits, as well as potentially removing them from a company later on. Zenefits is free for businesses and makes revenue by taking a commission as an insurance broker if clients end up changing their plans after signing with Zenefits.","follow_count":2,"license_count":null,"location":null,"meed_credits":0,"name":"Zenefits","video_urls":["https://youtube.com/watch?v=E-0EpztLz0c"]},"create_time":"2015-05-29T21:11:17+00:00","description":"<div>\r<br/><p>We all knew that cloud HR startup Zenefits is growing fast, but how fast exactly? At the 33rd Annual JPMorganChase Health Care Conference today, Zenefits CEO Parker Conrad plans to share some of the company's financials, which will put its growth numbers into perspective.</p>\r<br/><p>In a presentation this afternoon, Conrad will reveal that at the close of its fiscal year this month, Zenefits will surpass $20 million in annually recurring revenue after less than two years in business. That's up from $1 million at the same time last year, which means the company grew 20x over the last 12 months.</p>\r<br/><p>Based on its current growth trajectory, Zenefits expects annually recurring revenue to grow to $100 million over the next year. That might not seem like a lot, especially given the amount of money it's raised since being founded ( about $85 million) and its most recent valuation ($500 million).</p>\r<br/><p>But let's put the company's growth trajectory into context: It took SaaS businesses like Workday and Salesforce about four years to reach $20 million in annual recurring revenue; and it took each of them about five or six years to hit $100 million.</p>\r<br/><p>The most interesting thing about those numbers is that, unlike some other enterprise SaaS companies, Zenefits doesn't charge for use of its cloud-based HR platform. It's only if customers choose to designate it as their insurance broker that Zenefits makes any money. Even then, it receives a commission from the insurance provider, so customers continue to enjoy use of its platform for free.</p>\r<br/><p>All of this points to why private investors have been clamoring to invest in Zenefits, and why it has such aggressive plans to expand. It also might help explain why Yammer founder David Sacks came out of retirement to join Zenefits as COO despite already being a bazillionaire.</p>\r<br/><p>Zenefits started off 2014 by raising a pretty modest $15 million funding round from Andreessen Horowitz, but quickly added to its coffers. Six months later, it went back and got another $66.5 million from a16z and Institutional Venture Partners.</p>\r<br/><p>Based on its growth projections, the company has also been hiring aggressively. In 2014, the company went from 15 to more than 500 employees. Headcount is set to balloon even further, as Zenefits recently opened a 100,000-square foot office in Scottsdale, Ariz., where it expects to hire 1,300 employees over the next three years.</p>\r<br/><p>While Zenefits' revenue numbers are impressive, especially for a company that is just two years old, it's worth pointing out that not all revenue is created equal. It isn't clear how expensive its revenue is to generate, especially considering the massive increase in the company's headcount recently.</p>\r<br/><p>Other fast-growing SaaS businesses, like Box for example, eventually reported revenue that cost far more to generate than some expected.

Now it's making a case to grab the same title in 2015.</p>\r<br/><p>The HR startup announced on Wednesday morning that it raised a blowout $500 million in Series C funding in a round led by Fidelity and TPG. The new investment values Zenefits at a $4.5 billion valuation, hurdling the $1 billion mark to make it one of the top 20 most highly valued venture-backed tech startups in the world.</p>\r<br/><p>This is Zenefits' third funding round in less than a year and a half. The company raised $15 million in its Series A last January, then added $66 million in an June Series B round that valued it at more than $500 million.</p>\r<br/><p>Zenefits offers a cloud-based software-as-a-service human resources platform for small businesses that tries to be an all-in-one solution for compliance, onboarding, payroll, health insurance, and other employee benefits. The key is that the software is free to businesses; Zenefits makes its money as a broker of services, for example earning a fee from health insurers who register new businesses through Zenefits.</p>\r<br/><p>With this latest deal, cofounder and CEO Parker Conrad could become a billionaire. He tells Forbes that he remains the largest individual shareholder of Zenefits, although declines to cite his exact ownership percentage. The 34-year-old is now running a company with approximately 1,000 employees. He was previously the cofounder of Wikinvest, which became Sigfig, before getting kicked out in 2013. (Conrad's Zenefits cofounder and CTO Laks Srini is another Sigfig veteran.)</p>\r<br/><p>Conrad argues the money is well spent on upfront costs, including an explosion of new employees, especially in sales (Zenefits plans to double headcount this year). He hopes to make up that massive burn rate in the long run, as small business owners begin to rely on the service. \"Investors look at our SAAS metrics and say gosh, there's a lot that's exciting,\" says Conrad. \"They agree that we should be stepping on the gas and pushing the pedal to the floor. We're trying to get as much of the market as we can.\"</p>\r<br/><p>Zenefits is on a rocket ship trajectory. After reaching an annual recurring revenue figure of $1 million in January 2014, it grew by 20 times, reaching $20 million ARR a year later, and it expects $100 million by the beginning of 2016. The company says it closed more new business this past March than it did in the first 15 months of the company's life. Just over 40% of its 10,000 small business customers are outside of the tech industry.</p>\r<br/><p>Conrad wants to reach the 5 million small businesses in the U.S. with under 1,000 employees. While it costs an extraordinary amount to build a salesforce that can cold call every one, he argues the unit economics makes each new customer a worthwhile investment.</p>\r<br/><p>\"It's a lot easier to approach smaller companies,\" says Conrad of this approach. \"Try getting on the phone with a decision-maker at a 1,000-person company. It takes weeks if not months. We can close a lot more 100-person companies more easily.\"</p>\r<br/><p>Other VC firms who invested in Zenefits' current round include Founder Fund, Khosla Ventures, Insight Venture Partners, and Aston Kutcher's Sound Ventures. Previous investors Andreessen Horowitz, Insitutional Venture Partners, and Jared Leto all added to their stakes.</p>\r<br/>The Hottest Startups of 2014Follow Brian Solomon on Facebook and Twitter.</div>","embed_code":null,"external_url":null,"feed_rank":2323,"internal_id":null,"is_anonymous":null,"is_user_following_company":false,"job_ids":["5572260d05af2c1b74000028","5572278a05af2c1b7400002a"],"jobs":[{"_id":"5572260d05af2c1b74000028","company":"Zenefits","company_id":"zenefits","company_logo":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/ww6DAdroQ5qCOShRy43e/convert?w=100","company_overview":"Zenefits is a cloud-based human resources platform that allows businesses to manage multiple human resources services from a single cloud-based dashboard.

That's the common perception; If you go abroad, you won't be able to get a job when you get back. You won't be able to find something and you will be stranded. People will look at you like you aren't serious about your career. </p>\r<br/><p>This couldn't be further from the truth...</p>\r<br/><p>I personally believe that going abroad is better for your career than staying in the states. It will open your world up to a wealth of opportunities that you simply never knew about. It enables you to adapt to a new way of living, think on your feet, and be independent. Most importantly, it also allows you to remove yourself from the people who you grew up around, which enables you to pursue your interests, rather than what your friends and family have pressured you into thinking that you were interested in.</p>\r<br/><p>I get on calls every day and talk to people about co-working spaces, hackathons, impact investing, and many many more...most students have no idea that these fields even exist....I know I didn't when I came out of school. If I never traveled and moved to India I wouldn't have ever learned about these things.</p>\r<br/><p>Could I have learned about these things while living in the US? Absolutely. But the exposure to these fields while it was directly relevant in my life is what made it so powerful. I want to share that exposure with other people, and put them in environments where they can immerse themselves in a world that has always existed, but they never knew about. </p>\r<br/><p>Someone emailed me today and said,</p>\r<br/><p>\"I have been looking forward to joining the entrepreneurial community out in San Francisco after I graduate (as a salesman or marketer for a small to midsize biotech company), but an opportunity to work abroad would be a life changing experience!</p>\r<br/><p>Your program seems to be the best of both worlds, and I would be thrilled to get a chance to hear some more about it.\" </p>\r<br/><p>This statement, in a nutshell, is what we are working to do; give you the best of both worlds.</p>\r<br/><p> We are eliminating the choice. We are making it so that you don't have to choose between your career and travel - you can do both at the same time. You can have your cake and eat it too. Get career relevant experience in a foreign country and push your career to a new level that wouldn't be possible had you not traveled. </p>\r<br/><p>And the positions you are \"giving up\" in the states? They will always be there for you.</p>\r<br/><p>We often look at one year abroad as this enormous life altering decision, where we are leaving behind everything we have built up for ourselves over the last 20 some odd years...but thats not the case. In reality your life back home will always be there for you, it's not going anywhere. The same job that you could have gotten will still be available one year later. Your friends, family, everything will stay exactly how it was...but you wont.</p>\r<br/><p>One year later you will come back from traveling and working abroad and it will seem as if the world has been flipped on it's head. You will look at your career in an entirely new light, and where you want to take your life will forever have a new meaning. You will have opened up doors that will remain open for the rest of your life. </p>\r<br/>The choice is yours.... </div>","embed_code":null,"external_url":null,"feed_rank":338,"internal_id":null,"is_anonymous":null,"is_user_following_company":false,"job_ids":null,"kudos_count":null,"large_image_url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/resume/image/upload/v1435832295/ecj7nnozc9xztq59kcag.jpg","major_types":null,"medium_image_url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/resume/image/upload/c_fit,h_286,r_6,w_500/v1435832295/ecj7nnozc9xztq59kcag.jpg","path":"/braingain/2015/8/29/the-choice","photo_id":null,"poster_id":"braingain","poster_logo":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/W4uu0rdnQu2y0HCb4aTV/convert?w=100","poster_school":null,"poster_type":"company","privacies":null,"privacy":"everyone","privacy_text":null,"public_post":true,"scrape_id":null,"skills":null,"small_image_url":null,"subject_id":"the-choice","tag_line":null,"tags":null,"title":"The Choice","type":"story","url":"http://blog.getmeed.com/braingain/2015/7/2/the-choice","video_id":null,"video_type":null,"view_count":138,"viewer_gave_kudos":false},{"_id":"55dbc4c6f035176da6000019","caption":"Future of gas, what do you think will happen with the drop in gas prices.

Because when we travel time becomes distorted. One day in a foreign country can forever change the way that you think about life. One week trekking through the amazon, or taking a road trip will often be more impressionable on you than a year in university. A few months working abroad can forever shape what you want out of your career and your life.</p>\r<br/><p>I believe that anytime someone puts themselves outside of their comfort zone, it leads to an accelerated hyper growth; what I now refer to as \"growing in dog years\". In the same way that a dog theoretically ages 7 years in a year, I believe that when we travel, try new challenging things, and get outside of our comfort zones, we grow at a more rapid pace; we grow in \"Dog Years\". </p>\r<br/><p>You see, when we get outside of our comfort zones and try new things, we realize that time is not created equally. When time is maximized, and we pack as many overwhelming experiences into a short period of time, we grow at an accelerated rate because, quite simply, we experience more. The more that you experience, the more that you grow.</p>\r<br/><p>This is why when we return home from our travels it is so hard to relate to our friends. So much has taken place for us in the last year, but for them their lives have remained essentially the same. They might have a new job, or a new girlfriend/boyfriend, but in reality their lives haven't changed much throughout the course of that last year. They haven't experienced the same intensity and acceleration of growth because quite simply, they haven't experienced as much. </p>\r<br/><p>In my opinion, it is simply because you have grown more than they have in that same year. You have had more experiences. You have learned more things. You have widened your perspective in a way that they haven't. So you are literally no longer at the same points in your life, you have accelerated your own growth and are now years ahead of where they are.  In the same year that they grew only one year, you have grown probably 3-4x what they have.</p>\r<br/><p>Have you ever been in a position where you look back at the last 6 months and say to yourself, \"I feel like the last six months have passed by in the snap of a finger, but at the same time so much has happened and it feels like an eternity ago!\" This happens because you packed new experiences into your life, which made time pass by seemingly fast, but these experiences also accumulated at an insanely fast pace, making it seem like an eternity has passed. It's quite the contradictory feeling. </p>\r<br/><p>I look at it like \"hacking time\". If you want to get the most that you can out of your life, your goal should be to pack in as many new experiences as you possibly can into every year. If you look back on the last year of your life, how many new things did you try? How many impressionable events can you name? How many times did you take a new trip somewhere? How hard did you push yourself at work? How many new skills did you pick up? The more things you can list out, the more that you have grown.</p>\r<br/><p>Take something like Vipassana meditation for example. Although it might be a mere ten days long, in those ten days you will experience years of personal growth because it is such a novel and challenging experience. When you come out, you have grown more in the last ten days than your friends who didn't do it with you.  Unfortunately, I also think that it's necessary to touch on hardship, because hardship has a way of manipulating time, but in a bad way. Hardships and struggle have the potential to cause adverse growth. They have the ability to debilitate people and slow life down. </p>\r<br/><p>Hardships have a tendency to debilitate people. Something bad happens, and we sit in our rooms and sulk. We stop working. We stop moving forward. We stop growing. Months can pass in this way. Have you ever had a friend go through a failure and take months to get over it? Or a friend who broke up with a girlfriend/boyfriend and they take a year to get over it? Or, in the worst case scenario, the death of a family member? Situations like these have the ability to slow or entirely halt your growth, and it is important to be cognizant of this.</p>\r<br/><p>Hardships and struggle have the potential to either debilitate or motivate, and it is up to us with how we handle these hardships. We can either use them as an opportunity to grow, or a time to recess. Am I saying that if something bad happens ignore it and keep moving? Absolutely not. I am instead saying that with every struggle comes an opportunity for growth, and in the end it's up to you how long you let that struggle knock you on your ass, or get back up and keep fighting. </p>\r<br/><p>Where positive experiences speed life up and cause one to say \"time flies when you're having fun\", negative experiences have the ability to slow life down and make it seem like it passes forever. Have you ever noticed that when you are in a bad mood the day seems to pass by incredibly slowly? Or remember back to those days of sitting in a classroom and staring at a clock waiting for time to pass, and then you go outside for recess and it feels like you didn't get enough time to play? Funny how time becomes distorted depending on our mindset and how we are perceiving our experience of said time.      </p>\r<br/><p>This is why it is so important to schedule things into your year that will have the maximum impact on your growth. This is why it is so important to choose a challenging career path, travel and work abroad when the opportunity arises, and jump at novel experiences every time you get the chance. It's like the phrase \"getting the best bang for your buck\", but instead I look at it as, \"get the most shine for your time\" ;) (ok ok I'm working on it!)</p>\r<br/><p>Time is not created equally. It's up to you how you spend your time on this planet, and how fast or slow you want to grow. You have the ability to grow like everyone else, or grow in dog years. Personally, I choose to get the most out of every day that I am here on this planet and grow in dog years, and I encourage everyone else to do the same :)</p>\r<br/></div>","embed_code":null,"external_url":null,"feed_rank":338,"internal_id":null,"is_anonymous":null,"is_user_following_company":false,"job_ids":null,"kudos_count":null,"large_image_url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/resume/image/upload/v1435832628/dczapegbsovxzb5wnmip.jpg","major_types":null,"medium_image_url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/resume/image/upload/c_fit,h_400,r_6,w_698/v1435832628/dczapegbsovxzb5wnmip.jpg","path":"/braingain/2015/8/29/grow-in-dog-years","photo_id":null,"poster_id":"braingain","poster_logo":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/W4uu0rdnQu2y0HCb4aTV/convert?w=100","poster_school":null,"poster_type":"company","privacies":null,"privacy":"everyone","privacy_text":null,"public_post":true,"scrape_id":null,"skills":null,"small_image_url":null,"subject_id":"grow-in-dog-years","tag_line":null,"tags":null,"title":"Grow in Dog Years","type":"story","url":"http://blog.getmeed.com/braingain/2015/7/2/grow-in-dog-years","video_id":null,"video_type":null,"view_count":216,"viewer_gave_kudos":false}]
